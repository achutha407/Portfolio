# ðŸ‘‹ Hey there, I'm Achuthanantha N J

This is my personal portfolio website â€” a place where I showcase what Iâ€™ve built, what I love, and what Iâ€™m learning. From Java and Python to React and UI design, youâ€™ll find my skills, certifications, projects, and research all in one place. Built with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks), itâ€™s clean, responsive, and theme-toggle ready.
